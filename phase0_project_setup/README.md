# Flagship Ride-Hailing Data Engineering Platform 🚀

This project is a production-grade end-to-end data engineering system that simulates a modern
real-time data platform used in companies like Uber, Lyft, and Grab.

## Project Phases
The architecture is split into multiple deployable phases:

1. Phase 0 — Project Setup  
2. Phase 1 — Real-time Streaming Ingestion (Kafka → Bronze)  
3. Phase 2 — Silver Transformations (Spark Structured Streaming)  
4. Phase 3 — Gold Warehouse (PostgreSQL / Upserts)  
5. Phase 4 — Data Quality (Great Expectations)  
6. Phase 5 — Batch Aggregations (Daily Metrics)  
7. Phase 6 — Monitoring + Lineage  
8. Phase 7 — Dashboard + API  
9. Phase 8 — Kubernetes Deployment  

Each phase will be added as a separate folder and uploaded to GitHub as we build step-by-step.
